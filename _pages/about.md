I'm Maria, a Machine Learning Researcher at [Micrographia Bio](https://www.micrographiabio.com/). I have worked on a broad range of machine learning and computer science topics including probabilistic programming, variational inference, graph neural networks and geometric deep learning, programming language design and tooling, and program analysis. I have experience with applications to science, healthcare, and social media. 

Previously, I was at Twitter, where I contributed to various projects related to platform health, including [Birdwatch](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/), a tool for crowdsourced misinformation labelling.

I completed a PhD at the University of Edinburgh, advised by Andy Gordon and Charles Sutton. I worked on improving probabilistic programming languages and inference through program analysis.

Earlier, I was a Research Assistant at the University of Cambridge (the Graphics and Interaction Group), which is also where I obtained my BA from.
